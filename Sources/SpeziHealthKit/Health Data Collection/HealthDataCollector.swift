/// A data collector that continuously, over the lifetime of the application, collects samples and/or other data from the HealthKit database.
///
/// - Tip: The ``CollectSample`` configuration component provides an easy means for adding data collection to an app.
///     In most cases, it shouldn't be necessary to define and implement a custom data collector.
///
/// Custom `HealthDataCollector`s can be registered with the ``HealthKit-swift.class`` module
/// using ``HealthKit-swift.class/addHealthDataCollector(_:)-1sq79`` or ``HealthKit-swift.class/addHealthDataCollector(_:)-10bp6``.
/// The ``HealthKit-swift.class`` module will establish a strong reference to the collector,
/// which will exist for the entire lifetime of the application.

    /// The data collector's sample type
    var sampleType: SampleType<Sample> { get }
    
    /// The data collector's delivery setting.
    ///
    /// This determines when and how the collector is started once it has been registered with the ``HealthKit-swift.class`` module:
    /// - if the collector defines an automatic delivery setting, the collector will be told to start its data collection as soon as it is registered and the user
    ///     was asked to grant access to the collector's ``sampleType``
    /// - if the collector defines a manual delivery setting, it will be started the first time the application calls ``HealthKit-swift.class/triggerDataSourceCollection()``
