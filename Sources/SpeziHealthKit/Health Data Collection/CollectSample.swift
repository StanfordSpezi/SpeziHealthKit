/// Collects a specified ``SampleType``  via the ``HealthKit-class`` module.
///
/// This structure enables real-time Health data collection using the ``HealthKit-swift.class`` module, and allows defining when and how the collection should take place.
/// By default, all new samples of the provided ``SampleType`` will be collected; you an optionally provide a filter predicate.
///
/// Sample collection, unless specified otherwise, is started automatically (i.e., once the ``HealthKit-swift.class`` module has requested read access to the queried sample type).
/// This can be configured, allowing an app to delay starting of the sample collection until a moment of its choosing.
///
/// Sample collection optionally can be configured to continue in the background, i.e. even when the app is closed.
/// This is turned off by default, and can be enabled using the `continueInBackground` parameter.
///
/// Your app can specify an `NSPredicate` to filter which samples should be collected.
/// For example, you can use a predicate to only collect the data collected at a time within the given start and end date.
/// Below is an example to create a `NSPredicate` restricting the data collection to only the previous month.
/// ```swift
/// private var predicateOneMonth: NSPredicate {
///     // Define the start and end time for the predicate.
///     // In this example, we want to collect the samples in the previous month.
///     let calendar = Calendar(identifier: .gregorian)
///     let today = calendar.startOfDay(for: Date())
///     // We want the end date to be tomorrow so that we can collect all the samples today.
///     guard let endDate = calendar.date(byAdding: .day, value: 1, to: today) else {
///         fatalError("*** Unable to calculate the end time ***")
///     }
///     // Define the start date to one month before.
///     guard let startDate = calendar.date(byAdding: .month, value: -1, to: today) else {
///         fatalError("*** Unable to calculate the start time ***")
///     }
///     // Initialize the NSPredicate with our start and end dates.
///     return HKQuery.predicateForSamples(withStart: startDate, end: endDate)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Then, you just need to configure `predicate` with the  `predicateOneMonth` you defined as above during your initialization of ``CollectSample`` to only collect data samples in the previous month.
///
/// ```swift
/// CollectSample(.stepCount, predicate: predicateOneMonth)
/// ```
