// Essentially just a thread-safe dictionary that keeps track of our `LocalStorageKey`s used by the `SampleTypeScopedLocalStorage`.
// The reason this exists is bc the LocalStorage API is intended to be used with long-lived LocalStorageKey objects, which doesn't easily
// work with the multi-key scoping approach we're using here.
// Were we not to use something like this for caching and re-using the keys, we'd need to create temporary `LocalStorageKey`s for
// every load/store operation, which would of course work but would also defeat the whole purpose of having the `LocalStorageKey`s
// be long-lived objects which are also used for e.g. locking / properly handling concurrent reads or writes.
